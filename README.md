This repo is where I develop algorithms for figuring out solutions to bitgame puzzles. My first attempt to find the solutions to all bitgame pairs using only the five core bit-moves, although successful, was a highly inefficient brute-force algorithm that tried every possible combination and took on the order of two hours. The next version, which cleverly builds on already-discovered solutions, takes less than one second.

The next challenge is to figure out which pairs can be "short-circuited" using the register and binary bit operators.
